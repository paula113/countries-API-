## My process

I took on a Frontend Mentor challenge (Countries API) to learn Tailwind CSS and TypeScript, using technologies like React.js and Vite. I learned through hands-on practice and faced challenges understanding TypeScript fundamentals and implementing dark mode with Tailwind. I resolved these by exploring official documentation, reading blogs, and watching beginner-friendly videos. I completed the project in a week, which helped me begin to understand TypeScript and Tailwind, as well as concepts like debouncing. This experience boosted my ability to adapt quickly to new tools and frameworks.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind css - v3.4.17](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to declare variable and function types in TypeScript, as well as how to validate them effectively to catch potential errors early. I also gained hands-on experience in building responsive designs using Tailwind CSS, leveraging its utility-first classes and breakpoints to adapt layouts across different screen sizes.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


### Continued development

I want to deepen my understanding of TypeScript, especially its core concepts such as types, interfaces, generics, and type inference. Additionally, I aim to improve my use of Tailwind CSS by refining best practices for responsive design, utility class organization, and advanced features like theming and animations.
